            <h2 class ="about-me">About Me</h2>
            <p style =  "font-size: 16.35px;">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
            There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
            I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
            I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do 
            thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.</p>

                <h2 class = "about-me">Education</h2>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;">I am a sophomore pursuing my B.Tech in the department of Chemical Enginnering, along 
                with a minor in Computer Science, at IIT Bombay.</p>
                <p style = "font-size:20px;">I completed my education till Class 10 from Modern School, Nagpur and my Intermediate 
                from Disha Delphi Public School, Kota.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class = "about-me">My Hobbies</h2>
                <p style = "font-size:19.36px;">I’m an incessant reader: I more or less always have a book at hand—sometimes more than one.
                 My favorite genre is mysteries, particularly British and Scandinavian novels: I love a twisty plot 
                 and tend to pit my wits against the fictional sleuth to see whether I can figure out the solution 
                 before she/he does. I particularly admire Henning Mankell: I’ve learned more about history and politics 
                 from his mysteries than I ever was taught in school.What I truly treasure about my hobby is its power 
                 to transport me to different locations whilst I’m still on my couch. It is a low budget travel option that I often take!</p>

                <h2 class = "about-me">My Ambitions</h2>
                <p style = "font-size:17.5px;">I have always been passionate about Engineering but given the vast array of opportunities
                that are available to an engineer today, I am still exploring and am yet to decide what I really want to be. But I have 
                been always clear about one thing- and that is to become a better version of myself with every passing day.</p>
